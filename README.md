 Welcome to KATSPACE

The inspiration behind this app and it's purpose is purely the author's love of animals and my opinion that they deserve as much as us, if not more sometimes.
Just as we strive to help ourselves, so should we try and help homeless and hurt animals. Where better to begin than with cats.

The app itself offers the user the possibility to make an account, with which he/she can look in details the posts for adoption and eventually make contact with the people that published them,
thus eventually taking in a cat in need and making the world a better place.
The person can decide to post an animal that they want to help. In the post they can put all the necessary information for a firsthand basis.

The problem this app tries to solve is mainly helping people that want to help by making things happen easy, simple and in one place. The second thing the creator of this app tries to achieve is bringing compassion back into the hearts of people. At the very least remind them that there are still people, wanting to help in whatever ways they can and whoever they can.
