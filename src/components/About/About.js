        <h1>About <i>KatSpace</i></h1>
        <p>
          We are a non-profit organisation with the goal of helping cats in
          need. All of our team are first and foremost animal-lovers. Animals
          are leaving creatures just like us humans. As much as we deserve love
          and care so do they. While this company deals with cat adoptions only,
          we are planning a big expansion in the coming years. All abandoned
          animals need help and we plan to provide it to them all. <br />
          Yes, we know that so far some of you may think this is a scam of
          sorts. Afterall, how do we pay our employees salaries? The answer is
          simple - our founder is Rodolphe Delord, founder and director of the
          famous ZooParc de Beauval in Saint-Aignan-sur-Cher, France. Since the
          Mr. Delord knows he cannot take in all animals in need, he decided to
          create an international company, that will connect like-minded people
          across the world in an effort to find shelter for all rescued animals,
          no matter how big or small. There will never be a "buy" option on this
          or any future company website. All living beings deserve help and it
          should come from the kindness and love of our hearts, not from our
          pockets! <br />
          So this is us. This is our mission. If you want to help the world -
          adopt an animal. If you want to help the company itself grow and have
          a bigger reach - all donations are welcomed.
          <br />

          PS: Have you seen how cute the cats are here?
